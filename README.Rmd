> [!WARNING]  
> We strongly recommend that you migrate to the [ggEDA](https://github.com/CCICB/ggEDA) package, which provides a richer feature set, ongoing maintenance, and enhanced performance. The gg1d package is no longer under active development and will only receive essential bug-fixes.

Effortlessly visualize all columns in a data frame with vertically aligned plots and automatic plot selection based on variable type. Plots are fully interactive, and custom tooltips can be added.

A graphical user interface to all gg1d visualisations is available at https://CCICB.github.io/featurepeeker/

**Why 1 dimensional plots?**

To understand trends in your data, especially correlative relationships between 2 or more features, it can be useful to densely stack visual representations of each feature vertically, regardless of data type. By unifying the $x$-axis across each plot, **gg1d** turns a series of 1D plots into an $n\text{-dimensional}$ visualization where $n = \text{number of columns in dataset}$. 
Note the key idea of gg1d is to 'preserve the individual.' **gg1d** does **NOT** plot distributions of properties, but rather each value of a feature for each subject/observation in the dataset.

gg1d can be used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) or to produce publication quality graphics summarizing a dataset.


## Installation

``` r
install.packages("gg1d")
```

### Development Version

You can install the development version of gg1d from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require("remotes"))
    install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("selkamand/gg1d")
```

Or from R-universe with:

``` r
install.packages("gg1d", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

## Quick Start

For examples of interactive gg1d plots see the [gg1d gallery](https://selkamand.github.io/gg1d/articles/gallery.html)

```{r, example, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
# Load library
library(gg1d)

# Read data
path_gg1d <- system.file("example.csv", package = "gg1d")
df <- read.csv(path_gg1d, header = TRUE, na.strings = "")

# Plot data, sort by Glasses
gg1d(
  df,
  col_id = "ID",
  col_sort = "Glasses",
  interactive = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  options = gg1d_options(legend_nrow = 2)
)
```

## Customise Colours

Customise colours by supplying a named list to the `palettes` argument

```{r customise_colours, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
gg1d(
  df,
  col_id = "ID",
  col_sort = "Glasses",
  palettes = list("EyeColour" = c(
    Brown = "rosybrown4",
    Blue = "steelblue",
    Green = "seagreen"
  )),
  interactive = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  options = gg1d_options(legend_nrow = 2)
)
```


## Parallel Coordinate Plots

For datasets with many observations and mostly numeric features, parallel coordinate plots may be more appropriate.

```{r minibeans_class, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
ggparallel(
 data = minibeans,
 col_colour = "Class",
 order_columns_by = "auto",
 interactive = FALSE
)
```


```{r minibeans_highlight, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
 ggparallel(
   data = minibeans,
   col_colour = "Class",
   highlight = "DERMASON",
   order_columns_by = "auto",
   interactive = FALSE
 )
```

```{r minibeans_noclass, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
 ggparallel(
   data = minibeans,
   order_columns_by = "auto",
   interactive = FALSE
 )
```
